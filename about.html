  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>Maple Mountain IT was founded with a simple goal: to make technology easier for businesses. Drawing from years of experience in tech, we saw a need for service that not only solves problems—but actually cares about people. Our clients rely on us because we offer more than just support—we build trust, simplify workflows, and bring peace of mind to their IT operations.</p>

  <p>We pride ourselves on delivering personable, high-quality support rooted in a white-glove mentality. That means fast communication, proactive problem-solving, and treating your tech like it's our own.</p>

    <strong>Our Mission:</strong> To simplify IT and connect with others. We believe great service is personal, and technology should never get in the way of your goals.
